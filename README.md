# Smart-Terrarium---EcoTopia
A self-sustained ecosystem by using various sensors interfaced with Arduino UNO. A fan for temperature, a polychromatic LED arrangement for light, a misting fan for humidity and a drip irrigation system for soil moisture level have been implemented to restore these parameters to a pre-set threshold.
